# /etc/conf.d/clock

# Set CLOCK to "UTC" if your system clock is set to UTC (also known as
# Greenwich Mean Time).  If your clock is set to the local time, then 
# set CLOCK to "local".  Note that if you dual boot with Windows, then 
# you should set it to "local".

# Select the proper timezone.  For valid values, peek inside of the
# /usr/share/zoneinfo/ directory.  For example, some common values are
# "America/New_York" or "EST5EDT" or "Europe/Berlin".  If you want to
# manage /etc/localtime yourself, set this to "".

TIMEZONE="Africa/Cairo"

# If you wish to pass any other arguments to hwclock during bootup, 
# you may do so here.
